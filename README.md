MedicDiary  
A digital medical records system.

## Motivation

In our present day scenario, everytime a patient visits a new doctor or a new hospital, he is expected to carry all his previous medical records along with him which is usually in the form of papers. These records are essential because they contain all the previous medication he has been under or the treatments he has undergone, the knowledge of which might be necessary for future diagnosis. Moreover, this does not allow the patient to remotely share his medical history with any doctor because of the non-availability of these records in a digital format. With limited knowledge of a patient's past medical history, a doctor is very susceptible to misdiagnose, and this can lead to worsening of a patient's health. So in these times of Corona Outbreak, the need for an online healthcare facility has come up. So instead of maintaining these records on paper, maintaining them online in a database driven website can resolve the aforementioned problems. 

## Objectives

The patient and doctors can keep track of full medical history in a database that is remotely maintained by a third party. However maintained by a third party, only the patient and doctors selected by him will have access to it.
Secure flow of electronic information between patients and other clinicians, while avoiding the cumbersome process of maintaining written documents.
Reduction of costs through decreased paperwork, improved safety, reduced duplication of testing, and improved health.
Making patients aware by providing them information details on several diseases including the possible symptoms and the necessary precautions.
